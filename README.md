# Two Truths and a Lie

This is a two truths and a lie game. 

Users sign in with their name and create a card. From there the goal is to correctly guess which fact on each card is the lie. If the user guesses correctly they gain a point and choose another card. If they guess incorrectly, it's game over. If the user get a high score they will be allowed to add their initials to the leaderboard.

To guess a user must press the numeric key that corresponds with the sentence they think is a lie
